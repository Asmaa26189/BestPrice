- **market**(code-name-description-googleMapLink-country-city-region-address)
- **price**(marketId-itemId-price)

### Challenges:
- **What challenges have you discovered about your project that were not obvious when you did your research?**
  <br /> 
  - &emsp; There is no trust in the data as it is input from the end user.
  <br /> 
  - &emsp; Enter more than once repeatedly.
- **How have you had to change your plan to adapt to these unearthed challenges?**
  <br /> 
  &emsp; Repeating the same price for the same place will result in a large number of entries for the price, and therefore there will be confidence that the data is correct.
- **Describe any unexpected non-technical challenges?**
  <br /> 
  &emsp; Making the website work for different countries.
